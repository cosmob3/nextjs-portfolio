              I am Bryan Velasco, a Computer Science student with a strong
              interest in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and the future
              implications of quantum computing. My academic focus is
              complemented by hands-on experience in Python, HTML, and CSS, as
              well as a disciplined approach to self-learning and continuous
              improvement.
            </p>
            <p className="text-2xl p-5">
              Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with plans to
              minor in Data Science, I am particularly drawn to the practical
              and ethical dimensions of cybersecurity. I aim to deepen my
              expertise through certifications and project-based learning, with
              a long-term goal of contributing to secure, innovative
              technological solutions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-2xl p-5">
              My background includes professional experience in customer-facing
              roles, where I developed strong communication, time management,
              and problem-solving skills. Outside of academics and work, I am
              committed to personal developmentâ€”maintaining a consistent fitness
              routine, building healthy habits, and exploring creative outlets
              such as music mixing. I bring a growth mindset, resilience, and a
              genuine passion for technology to every opportunity I pursue.
